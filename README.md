# Title: Parallax 

- Repository: `challenge-parallax`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning Challenge`
- Duration: `2 days`
- Deployment strategy : 
	- Github page
	
- Team challenge : `solo`


## The Mission
In this repository you will find some images. If you position them over eachother in the right order you will get a pretty background. Our goal now will be to animate each piece based on how far it is in the background. The first layer (the ground) will move fastest, the last (the sky) will be static.

## Must-have features

- A page with a moving background that looks natural

- Something of your personal choosing to enhance the page, go take a look at the suggestions or come up with something yourself!

## Suggestions
- Make a platform game / endless runner

- Make an infomercial for the environment (or anything else)

- Make your own images to use for the parallax

- Enhance the scenery with some characters

- Make a short movie, you can stop the scroller or make it go in any direction and add some characters
